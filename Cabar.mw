The '''Caber toss''' is a traditional [[Scotland|Scottish]] athletic event involving the tossing of the [[caber]], a large wooden pole.

To toss the caber, the thrower first cups their hands together. The caber is then held vertically with the 'bottom' end in the cupped hands of the thrower. Continuing to hold the caber vertically (which requires a good deal of careful balance!), the thrower runs forward and tosses the caber into the air so that it turns 180° end-over-end in the air and lands on the former 'top' end. Because the caber still has angular [[momentum]], the former 'bottom' end then, hopefully, falls forward, away from the thrower.

The object is not the distance of the throw, but to have the caber fall directly away from the thrower after landing. A perfect throw ends with the 'top' end nearest to the thrower and the 'bottom' end pointing exactly away from the thrower. If the throw isn't perfect, it is scored by viewing that caber as though it were a hand on the clock with better scores nearer to 12:00; pointing to 11:00 is better than, say, pointing to 10:30. Farther down in the rankings, if the caber, upon landing on its end, falls back towards the thrower, then the score for that throw is based on the maximum vertical angle that the caber achieved. In this case, for example, 87°, almost over the top, is better than 75°.

A traditional caber is around 16 - 20 feet long and weighs around 80-130 pounds. The size, and particularly the length, of the caber mean that enormous strength is required simply to balance it vertically, and even more is required to toss it. For competitions involving less skilled athletes a shorter and/or lighter caber is used. After a few tosses, it's not unusual for a caber to break in the course of a competition.

The game originated in [[Scotland]] some hundreds of years ago, and is a regular fixture at [[Highland Games]]. 

The word ''Caber'' (or ''kaber'') comes from [[Scottish Gaelic]] 'cabar'.
