'''Hints''':
* box on right side: usual WP info or at least a more easily readable image
* Initial summary: leave more or less as it is, possibly add US
* Areas: mention mutual understandability with Slovak (easternmost dialects closer to Slovak than Czech)
* at Aibidil give also IPA pronunciations
* Connragan: caron (gd=???)
* Fuaimeagan: acute accent (gd=?), i/y
