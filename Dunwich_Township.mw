Tha '''Dunwich Township''' an siorrachd Eilginn an [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. Bha Thomas Talbot na [[uachdaran]]-fearainn. 'Sa bhliadhna 1820 bha [[Gaidheal]]-poball math gu leòr seasmhach ann an Dunwich Township. 

:''"So many came from [[Argyllshire]], that when the Marquis of Lorne, as Governor General, visited St. Thomas in 1881, the descendants of these early settlers gathered in thousands and presented him with an address... The Marquis informed his audience that he had never seen, even in Argyllshire itself, so many Argyllshire people present at one time (Lucille H. Campey, 2005:125)."''

Labhair Reverend William Proudfoot à [[Lunnainn]], nuair a rinn e cèilidh air Talbot-rèiteach: 
:''"a stiff-necked race. They will not understand anything that is not spoken in Gaelic... I felt very little interest in them today, chiefly because of their obstinate refusal to hear the Gospel because it is not in Gaelic (Lucille H. Campey, 2005:125)."
