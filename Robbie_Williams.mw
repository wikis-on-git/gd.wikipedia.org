'''Raibeart Peadar MacUilleim''' (Rugadh [[13 An Gearran]], [[1974]] ann am [[Burslem]], [[Stoke-on-Trent]], [[Siorrachd Stafford]]).  Tha e na sheinneadair Shasannach.

==Eachdraidh Beatha==

===Take That===
Thoisich Robbie ann an saoghal a' phop leis a' chomhlan-ciuil, ''[[Take That]]'' a bha ga stiùireadh leis an t-seinneadair/bàrd [[Gary Barlow]].  Chaidh an comhlan-ciuil a steidheachadh ann an [[1991]] agus bha iad gu math soirbheachail, a' ruigsinn aireamh a h-Aon ochd tursan.  Chruthaich an soirbheachas cothroman do chomhlan-ciuil choltach mar [[Boyzone]] agus [[Comhlan-ciuil|911].  Ge-ta, thathar a radh nach d' fhuair Robbie air adhart le buill eile sa chomhlan-ciuil air sgàth's a fheartan bhlèigeardach, agus bha e an comhanidh strì leis na buill agus leis an rianachd.  Dh'fhàg e Take That ann an [[1995]].  Faicibh ''[[Dealachadh Take That]].''  

===Leis Fhèin===

====As deidh Take That====
As deidh dha ''Take That'' fhàgail, anns a' bhad thoisich Williams ga bhogadh fhèin ann an doigh-beatha [[Ròc is Roll]] comhla ris a' chomhlan ciuil [[Oasis]].  Lean seo ri strì gu math poblach le [[drogaichean]] agus [[deoch laidir]].  Chuir e air mòran cuideam agus bhiodh e tric a' nochdadh mar bhurach, gun bhearradh is gun nighe. As deidh dha a thuiteam às a cheile le Oasis gu math poblach,  thug [[Noel Gallagher]] "[[That Fat Dance from Take That]]" air.     

Cha robh meadhnan ciuil na RA den bheachd gum biodh an Williams mi-modhail seo na shoirbheachadh mar neach-ciuil.  Bhathar an duil gum biodh buill eile bho [[Take That]] na bu shoirbhealaiche, gu h-àraidh [[gary Barlow]] sgu gu h-ìre [[Mark Owen]].

====''Life Thru A Lens''====
Ann an [[1996]], bha Williams deiseil a dhreuchd mar sheinneadair leis fhein a thoiseachadh gu ceart.  Mar a chiad chlar aige, chuir e a-mach "Freedom", seann òrain le [[Seoras MacGhilleMhichel]] anns an Lunasdal.  As deidh greis ann an clionaig deoch-laidir, chadh "Freedom" a leantainn le "Old Before I Die".  Rainig an dithis aca aireamh a Dha air na chartaichean RA.  Lean seo gu foillseachadh a chiad chlar, ''Life Thru A Lens", nas anmoiche ann an 1997.

Bha "Freedom" agus "Old Before I Die" air ''Life Thru A Lens'' - ach bhathar a' beachdach gun robh e na bhriseadh duil agus cha do shoirbhich an atha dha chlar idir, 'Be iadsan "Lazy Days" agus "South of the Border".

====Angels====
An t-òran mu dheireadh a chaidh a chur a-mach bhon a' chlar aig ám na [[Nollaig]] 1997, bha "Angels" na oran gaoil, agus thog e ''Life Thru A Lens'' gu Aireamh a h-Aon air na chartaichean, (28 seachdainean as deidh dha a chur a-mach).  Tha cliù aige mar an Òran a shabhail dreuchd Williams, agus tha e fhathast gu math taitneach gu mòran an-diugh.


Dh'fhás Williams ainmeil gu math luath anns an Rioghad Aonaichte le moran chlaran eile a' do l a-steach dhan a' Phriomh Deich, ach cha robh buaidh mhòr aige anns na Staitean.  Bha ''Millennium'', steidhichte air criomag bhon òran [[James Bond]]''[[You Only Live Twice]]'', na airmah a h-Aon anns an RA an an [[1998]] ach cha d' rainig e ach Aireamh 72 sna Staitean.

====''I've Been Expecting You''====
His second album "I've Been Expecting You" continued in the James Bond/spy theme and topped the UK charts in October 1998. In [[1999]] he collaborated with singer [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] for a track on the album [[Reload (Tom Jones album)|Reload]].

He had another minor hit in the [[United States]] in [[2000]] with the song "Rock DJ", but continued the trend of never achieving the same level of fame and success there as he had in the UK. The video for the song featured Williams in a [[roller disco]] as he stripped [[nude]] and then proceeded to 'strip off' his own [[flesh]], [[muscle]] tissue and [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s and feed them to female dancers until he was nothing but a dancing [[skeleton]].  The negative reaction to the gruesome video has been cited as temporarily ending any momentum his career had going in the US.

It is said that the frontal nudity was edited out in the US while the gore was left in, whereas the opposite was true for the UK. Even so, the video's ending was cut by many TV stations around the world and the whole video was forbidden in some countries (VH1 Europe even made their own video out of recording studio footage). Williams has built quite a reputation for appearing nude (or nearly nude) in photographs, videos and live performances.

====''Sing When You're Winning''====
After a smash third album with ''Sing When You're Winning'' in the summer of 2000, Williams' genuine global success was cemented in 2001 after a duet cover version of the [[Frank Sinatra|Frank]] and [[Nancy Sinatra]] song "Somethin' Stupid" with [[Australia]]n actress [[Nicole Kidman]], who was fresh off of her [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-nominated performance in ''[[Moulin Rouge]]''. 

====''Swing When You're Winning''====
Also in [[2001]] he released a whole [[album]] of classics entitled ''Swing When You're Winning'' in which his image was tamed down and polished as he breezed through [[jazz]], [[blues]] and pop standards from the fifties and sixties including "Ain't That A Kick In The Head" and "Mack The Knife". Williams' cover of the [[Bobby Darin]] classic "[[Beyond the Sea (song)|Beyond the Sea]]" from the album was later included on the ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' soundtrack in 2003 and helped to re-establish his appeal in the US.

====''Escapology''====
In 2002 Williams stopped working with his long-term writing partner [[Guy Chambers]]. However, they reunited six months later to work on the next album, ''Escapology'', which was released in late 2002. The first single from it, "Feel," was a massive European hit, accompanied by a stylish black & white video featuring [[Darryl Hannah]]. The intriguing cover depicts Williams dangling from a crane in bare feet, to symbolise the "escapology" theme.

The video for the next "Escapology" single, "Come Undone," was heavily censored by [[MTV Networks Europe]] for depicting a debauched (but fully-clothed) Williams having three-way [[sexual intercourse|sex]] with two women. The video also showed unsettling images of [[insect]]s and [[reptile]]s. During such furores at this time, it was confirmed that Williams and [[Guy Chambers]] were to officially part ways.

====Recent career====
In 2002, the UK public voted Williams to be on the BBC's list of the 100 Greatest Britons.  He was also voted 17th in Channel 4's 100 Worst Britons poll.

A best-selling official biography written by Chris Heath  "Feel", was  published in 2004, and chronicled events that led up to to the "Live Summer Tour 2003", during which Williams performed live to more than a million people over three days in August at Knebworth Park in Hertfordshire; while 3.5 million more watched live on television and on the Internet. Leading up to Knebworth, in December 2003, Williams toured Australia and New Zealand alongside Duran Duran.

Since the split with Chambers, Williams has begun to set out to prove his naysayers wrong. Armed with a new songwriting partner, [[Stephen Duffy]], Williams has penned several new songs, including the retro electro-throb of the UK #1 hit "Radio".

The tune is taken from Williams' 19-track "Greatest Hits" album, released in October 2004. In February 2005, Williams received the British music industry's award for the best song of the past quarter century, "Angels," the song Williams credits with giving him a career.

Williams' also performed at [[Live 8 concert, London|the Live 8 concert in London]] in [[2005]] where he was acknowledged as one of the stars of the show. It showed his ability to hold a large concert crowd, including the amusing incident when he acknowledged that the crowd at [[Hyde Park]] didn't all know the lyrics to 'Feel'.

===Williams' lifestyle===
Williams is currently single and now lives in Los Angeles, California. Speculation about his ambiguous sexuality and romantic life is rampant in the British media. Williams seems to encourage an image as a smooth womanizer and there are numerous widely-circulated Internet accounts allegedly written by Williams's female sexual partners extolling his considerable prowess as a lover. A regular feature of his live performances is full-on [[french kiss]]es with female fans plucked from the audience. 
  
Bearing in mind the persistent rumours about his sexuality and the appearance of so many column inches devoted to Williams's real or imagined romantic conquests, whether gay or straight, it is interesting to note that these accounts typically coincide with the release of a latest album, single, or live performance. Coincidental or not, much of what is written is utterly made up and probably attributable to a phalanx of publicity agents hired  to get Williams's name in the papers when he is trying to market his new project.
