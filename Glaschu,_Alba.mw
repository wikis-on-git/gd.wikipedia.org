It is also one of 32 unitary council regions in Scotland, officially known as City of Glasgow and, like many west of Scotland councils is effectively a Labour fiefdom, having been run by the party for well over 30 years. Glasgow had a population of 577,869 at the time of the 2001 census, while approximately 1.2 million people live in the city's greater metropolitan area. The name comes from the Brythonic glas cu (compare modern Gaelic Glaschu), meaning green hollow, and usually romantically translated as "the dear green place". It is popularly referred to as "Glesga" by Glaswegians who are sometimes disparagingly known as "keelies" or "weegies" by other Scots. Rivalry between Scotland's main towns can appear intense but is seldom significant. Scots from the Scottish Highlands and the Western Isles are known as "teuchters" by the keelies.

The map coordinates of the centre of the city are approximately 55°52' N, 4°15' W.
