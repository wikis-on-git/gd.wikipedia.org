'''-hou''' is a suffix found commonly in [[Channel Islands]] and [[Normandy|Norman]] names. It is the [[Norman language]] version of the [[Old Norse]] ''holmr'', meaning a small island, and often found anglicised elsewhere as "holm". It can still be found in modern Scandinavian languages, e.g. Stockholm.
