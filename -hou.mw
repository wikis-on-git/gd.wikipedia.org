'''-hou''' is a suffix found commonly in [[Channel Islands]] and [[Normandy|Norman]] names. It is the [[Norman language]] version of the [[Old Norse]] ''holmr'', meaning a small island, and often found anglicised elsewhere as "holm". It can still be found in modern Scandinavian languages, e.g. Stockholm.

The Norman toponym and [[diminutive]] ''hommet/houmet'' also derives from this element. 

In [[French language|Parisian French]], the equivalent is ''îlot'', which is cognate with the English "islet".
