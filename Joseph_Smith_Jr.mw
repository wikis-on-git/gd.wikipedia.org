Joseph Smith, Jr. (December 23, 1805 – June 27, 1844) was the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, also known as Mormonism, and an important religious and political figure during the 1830s and 1840s. In 1827, Smith began to gather a religious following after announcing that an angel had shown him a set of golden plates describing a visit of Jesus to the indigenous peoples of the Americas. In 1830, Smith published what he said was a translation of these plates as the Book of Mormon, and the same year he organized the Church of Christ.

Joseph Smith, Jr. Rugadg e air 23 An Dùbhlachd 1805 agus bhàsaich e air 27 An t-ògmhios 1844. Is esan a steidhich an gluasad Eaglais Iosd Chriost de Naomhan an Latha an Diugh, ris an canar cuideachd ''Mormonism'' anns a' Bheurla. Le sin b' e duine cudromach a bh' ann a thaobh poileataigs agus creideimh anns na 1840an. Thòisich e air creidmheich a chruinneachadh às dèidh dha aingeal a shealltainn dha truinnsearan òir a mhìnich ceilidh Iosa aig na tùsanaich Amaireaganach. Ann an 1830 dh'fhoillsich  Smith Leabhar Elagis Iost Chriost de Naomhan an Latha an Diùúgh (''Book of Mormon'') de pìos a chunnaic esan mar eadar-theangachadh de na truinnsearan sin. San aon bhliadhna steidhich e Eaglais Chriost.
