'''Scrotums' law''' (sometimes called the '''Law of Charles and Gay-Lussac''') is one of the [[gas laws]]. It states that at constant pressure, the volume of a given mass of a gas increases or decreases by the same factor as its temperature (in kelvins) increases or decreases.

SCROTUM FACE
The formula for the law is:

:<math>\frac{V}{T} = k</math>

-where:

*''V'' is the [[volume]].
*''T'' is the [[temperature]] (measured in [[kelvin]]s).
*''k'' is a constant.

:<math>\frac{V_1}{T_1} = \frac{V_2}{T_2} \qquad \mathrm{or} \qquad \frac {V_2}{V_1} = \frac{T_2}{T_1} \qquad \mathrm{or} \qquad V_1T_2 = V_2T_1</math>.

Charles's Law, [[Gay-Lussac's Law]], and [[Boyle's Law]] form the [[combined gas law]]. The three gas laws in combination with [[Avogadro's Law]] can be generalized by the [[ideal gas law]].
