'''Charles's law''' (sometimes called the '''Law of Charles and Gay-Lussac''') is one of the [[gas laws]]. The law was first published by [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] in [[1802]], but he referenced unpublished work by [[Jacques Charles]] from around [[1787]]. This reference has led to the law being attributed to Charles. The relationship had been anticipated by the work of [[Guillaume Amontons]] in [[1702]]

Charles law states that, at constant pressure, the volume of a given mass of a gas increases or decreases by the same factor as its temperature (in Kelvin) increases or decreases. The formula for this law is:

:<math>\frac{V}{T} = k</math>

-where:

*''V'' is the [[volume]].
*''T'' is the [[temperature]] (measured in [[Kelvin]]s).
*''k'' is a constant.

To maintain the constant, ''k'', during heating of a gas at fixed pressure, the volume must increase. Conversely, cooling the gas decreases the volume.  The exact value of the constant need not be known to make use of the law in comparison between two volumes of gas at equal pressure:

:<math>\frac{V_1}{T_1} = \frac{V_2}{T_2} \qquad \mathrm{or} \qquad \frac {V_2}{V_1} = \frac{T_1}{T_2} \qquad \mathrm{or} \qquad V_1T_2 = V_2T_1</math>.

Charles's Law, [[Gay-Lussac's Law]], and [[Boyle's Law]] form the [[combined gas law]]. The three gas laws in combination with [[Avogadro's Law]] can be generalized by the [[ideal gas law]].
